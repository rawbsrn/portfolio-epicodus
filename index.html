<h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Rob, and I am working on this as a learning exercise. I am 30 years old, and currently live in southern Nevada. I am currently a student with Epicodus. Prior to Epicodus, I worked in IT for roughly five years before deciding that I wanted to do something different. While I had previously dabbled in programming and web design (as you will see), I hadn't done much with it. A few epiphanies later, I decided to expand upon my technical skill set and see what else I could learn before diving back into the job market.</p>
